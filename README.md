# Cakep-AI
My first REAL program, Its a program that is totally useless if you use the alias command, but it might be handy for some linux beginners like me :)

# Oh my god SocniTheForker, Your code sucks!
i know that it does, but i wrote this program on day 2 of me beginning with programming, if you want to change it, feel free to fork it and optimize it.

# Versions
Currently the dependencies are downloaded with APT. In the future i will:
1: Make multiple versions for different package managers
2: Find a way to detect a package manager

# Tips/Ideas
If you got any tips or ideas, make a fork with them added or send a DM on discord to SocniðŸŽ„#6082
